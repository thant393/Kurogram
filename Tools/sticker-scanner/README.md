# Official sticker auto-scanner

Automatically finds Telegram's official sticker packs and adds any new ones to our
backend database, on a schedule, with no manual work after the one-time setup below.

## What this actually does (please read)

- Telegram does **not** provide an API that lists "every official sticker pack that
  exists." The closest real thing is Telegram's own **featured stickers** list - packs
  Telegram's team curates and updates over time. This scanner reads that list (plus its
  older backlog) and keeps only the ones Telegram marks as `official`. When Telegram adds
  a new one to that list, this scanner will pick it up on its next scheduled run.
- Telegram's API has **no category field** for sticker packs, so every pack this
  scanner adds gets `category: "Custom"` - same as you described (fill in a category if
  one exists, otherwise default to Custom; there's simply never one available here).
- Each pack has a nested `owner` object (`telegram_id`, `display_name`, `username`,
  `avatar_url`, `avatar_file_id`, `updated_at`). Scanner-added packs are owned by the
  official **@Stickers** bot (id `429000`). Older documents with the flat
  `owner_telegram_id` are converted by `migrate_owner_object.py` - run the **Owner Migration**
  workflow once (Actions tab; leave "Dry run" ticked first to preview, then untick it).

## One-time setup

1. In this Codespace's terminal:
   ```
   cd Tools/sticker-scanner
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 login.py
   ```
2. It will ask for your **API ID** and **API hash** - these are the same `API_ID` /
   `API_HASH` values already saved as repo secrets for the Android app build. (Settings →
   Secrets and variables → Actions, to view the names, though the values are hidden -
   just re-enter the same ones you used before.)
3. It will then ask for a phone number and the login code Telegram sends you. This logs
   in once, right here, and never needs to happen again.
4. That's it - in a Codespace, `gh` (GitHub's CLI) is already installed and signed in,
   so the script saves the session string straight to the repo as the
   `TELEGRAM_SESSION_STRING` secret for you. Nothing to copy or paste.

   If `gh` isn't available for some reason, the script falls back to printing the
   string instead, with instructions to add it by hand under
   **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**.

**Security note:** that string is equivalent to being logged into a Telegram account
from a new device - treat it like a password. Since this will run unattended on a
schedule, it's safer to use a secondary/throwaway Telegram account for this login
rather than your main personal account - if that account ever needs to be logged out,
you can do that from Telegram's own Settings → Devices on that account.

## Running it

- It runs automatically on a schedule once `.github/workflows/sticker-scan.yml` is in
  place (no action needed from you).
- To run it manually any time: go to the repo's **Actions** tab → **Sticker Scanner** →
  **Run workflow**.
- Each run prints a summary (how many official packs were found, how many were new, how
  many were added) in the workflow's log.
