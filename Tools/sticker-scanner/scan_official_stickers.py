"""
Finds the sticker packs Telegram publicly features in its app and adds any that aren't in our backend yet.

IMPORTANT LIMITATION (read this before relying on it): Telegram has no API that lists
"every official sticker pack that exists" - no such catalog exists on their side at
all. The closest real thing is the "featured stickers" list: a set of sticker packs
Telegram's own team curates and periodically updates (messages.getFeaturedStickers),
plus an older/paginated backlog of previously-featured ones
(messages.getOldFeaturedStickers). That's what this script scans. It is a good proxy
for "official stickers, and alert me to new ones" (new official packs do get added to
this list over time), but it is NOT guaranteed to be literally 100% of every sticker
pack Telegram has ever published - there is no such complete list to query in the
first place.

What it does each run:
  1. Logs into Telegram with a pre-created session (see login.py - run that once).
  2. Fetches the current featured sticker sets, then pages through the older featured
     sticker backlog, keeping every sticker set Telegram publishes there (not just ones flagged `official`; emoji and mask packs are skipped).
  3. Fetches the short_names already in our own backend (paginating the existing
     GET /api/v1/stickers list endpoint) so we never try to add a duplicate.
  4. Adds any newly-found short_name to the backend as a new pack, with
     category "Custom" (Telegram's API has no per-pack category/genre field at all,
     so there is nothing real to auto-detect here - every auto-added pack lands in
     "Custom" until/unless a smarter categorizer is built later) and
     a nested `owner` object for Telegram's own @Stickers bot (id 429000, the account
     Telegram publishes its public packs through). Documents that still have the old flat
     owner_telegram_id are converted by migrate_owner_object.py.

Environment variables (see .github/workflows/sticker-scan.yml for how these are
supplied in CI, or export them yourself to run this locally):
  API_ID, API_HASH            - same Telegram app credentials the Android build uses
  TELEGRAM_SESSION_STRING     - from running login.py once
  STICKER_API_BASE_URL        - e.g. https://backend-api-gn09.onrender.com
  STICKER_API_KEY             - optional; sent as "Authorization: Bearer <key>" if the
                                 backend's create-pack endpoint needs it. Leave unset
                                 if it doesn't.
